	This report is used to investigate the murder of Joshua Zarkan's girlfriend Sylvia. Upon investigation of the USB drive, two files were recovered, a .txt file and an excel file. The .txt file was revealed to be a suicide note, suggesting Sylvia had lost the will to live. The excel file was a catalog of Sylvia's financial assets, including the value of her stocks, bonds, real estate, annuities, savings account value, and life insurance.
	All of Sylvia's assets combined for a total value of $2,796,000.00. There is no evidence to suggest next of kin for inheritance of all of her assets. It is also very peculiar that the suicide note was left on the USB drive that had an account of her financial assets, rather than written in person at the time of her death. It is my recommendation that her boyfriend, Joshua Zarkan, be held under suspicion, if the death were to be deemed a murder.
